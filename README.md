# Layered-Audio-File-Analysis---MIS
This project, part of the MIS (Multimedia Information Systems) Lab Assignment, involves the analysis of a layered audio file saved with different technical specifications.

The audio file created for the project was saved using two different sample rates and three separate file formats.

Analyzed Parameters
Sample Rates: 44100 Hz (studio quality) and 8000 Hz (low quality).
File Formats: WAV (uncompressed), MP4A (balanced compression), and MP3 (high compression).

Findings
The analysis showed that the sample rate directly affects file size. The 44100 Hz sample rate results in a larger file size compared to 8 kHz, but it delivers a higher quality sound that is most suitable for the human ear.

A comparison of file formats yielded the following results:

WAV: Offers the highest sound quality and the largest file size. It is generally used in professional applications like audio processing and detection.
MP4A: Strikes a mid-level balance between quality and file size.
MP3: Provides the smallest file size but also has the lowest sound quality.

This study demonstrates the important trade-off between quality, storage space, and intended use in audio technology.
